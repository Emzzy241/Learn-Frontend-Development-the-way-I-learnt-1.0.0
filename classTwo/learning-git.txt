   A. How Do I Download Git? =====> 
        On google chrome, or Mozilla Firefox or whatever Browser you are making use of, Search: Download Git Bash for Windows(Be sure to change Windows to a Mac or a Linux/Unix Operating System If you Use any of them)
        Or you could visit this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads and you can select your Operating System right there

        Having Covered the How TO Download Git, Let's move on to the next CONTENT
    <=====


    
   B. Benefits of Using Git =====> 
        A Huge Chunk on How Beneficiary Git is has been covered in the Previous class(classOne) but as a bit of Summary here are sum of them:
        * You Become the Boss of your Own code
        * You can literally store thousands and thousand of Projects on your Github Repositiory
        * You can choose to make any of your Repository Public or Private
        * You can Clone, Fork(we will be covering this later) People's codes, make changes to them and re-push them to your own Repositiory
        * And Many More
    <=====



    C. When would I write my FIrst Git Command? ======>
        And the answer to that is: Right Now!
        If Truly Git was Downloaded and Installed, then on your Desktop(an empty space) right-click and select the option: Git Bash Here.

        A Prompt gets Opened for you, with your Desktop Name shown on it, That Prompt is called the Git Terminal, As you can see you can write in that Terminal.
        In that Prompt, write the following:
        --> mkdir Learn 
        THen Enter; Look into your Destop Screen an you see a yellow stuff has been created with the name: Learn. That yellow stuff is called a FOlder or as we call it n Programming 
        I KNOW you are wondering what the mkdir command is, just know that its a command that helps you create folders in any Location, right now you are in your Desktop and a Folder has been created for you there
        Again, mkdir stands for make directory..... We tell Git to make us a directory and then when specify what we want to name it


        The next is: 
        --> touch myFile.txt
        The touch Command helps us create Files of any extension(a .txt extension is the file extension for a text documents)
        Practice creating other file like that of Microsoft Document with is a fileName.docx, a music file: myMusic.mp3, a video file: myVid.mp4
        N


        <======

        D. What More can I expect From Git? =====>
            Answer: Many any Things, I told you earlier on that Git is a very Powerful tool and creating a Folder and a File like we did above is just one of the few things it can do

        <=====

        E. Alternatives To Git    ====>
            Since we would solely be making use of GIt in all classes, Sorry I won't be teaching you on their Alternatives; but you should know there are: THere is Gitlab, and may more.
            Be sure to explore all of THem Further
        <=====



        Create many directories[folders or yellow stuff :)], Research more types of files and create them 
        Create them today, tomorrow, next tomorrow e.t.c
        Don't Forget to go for Discipline and not Motivation

        F. End of Class Two  ====>
            That's a Wrap FOr now; Seeyou in the Next Class ---- Have Fun and don't forget to keep Smiling :)
