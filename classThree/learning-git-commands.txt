    A. Other things the Command mkdir(make directory) can achieve
    B. THE touch Command
    C. THE ls Command
    D. SUMMARIZING THE CLASS



  Today we will be learning more commands on our amazing GIT

    A. Other things the Command mkdir(make directory) can achieve 
    ====>
        Last Class we talked about the command: mkdir
        LEts summarize a bit on how powerful this command is:

        Yes, so when you want to create a Folder, correct me If I am wrong, you First righ-click, then you select New and you click on Folder
        Right?
        Yeah
        BUT What if you wanted to create 10 folders at a goal, that means 10 right-clicking..... Woah, thats a lot of work and I can tell you that no one likes to do a lot of work.
        And the fact that you are following this course means we won't be doing a lot of work but we will be working smartly :)

        Now, to create 10 folders with our Git Bash Terminal, we simply do: mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3 folder4 folder5 folder6 folder7 folder8 folder9 folder10
        NOTE: You must keep a space between each folders Name so git won't think they're all one folder with a very long name.... If you avoid the spaces, you see git creates you only 1 folder with the name: Folder1Folder2Folder3Folder4Folder5....

        HAVING SAID THAT, LET US MOVE ON TO ANOTHER COMMAND

    <====

    B. THE touch Command
    ====>
        Last Class, we briefly talked about this command, now in this class we will be using this command to create many more type of files
        The "touch" Command is used to create a file of any extension, and when we say any extension, it could mean the .txt(a text file), the .html(an html file), the .css(a css file), the .mp4(a video file), e.t.C

        Now, let us create more files. DO THE FOLLOWING IN THE git bash Terminal:
        touch myFile.pdf --> THis creates you a PDF file
        touch myFile.html ---> THis creates you an HTML file
        touch myFile.mp3 ---> this creates you an Mp3(a music) file
        touch myFile.Mp4 ---> this creates you an Mp4(a video) file


        Also, you can create multiple folders with the touch command(just like we did with our mkdir command), all you have to do is: touch myFileOne.mp3 myFileTwo.pdf myFileThree.html myFileFour.zip
        AND YOU CAN CREATE MANY OTHER TYPES OF file

        Don't forget; the goal is to get Disciplined with coding and not source for Motivation with coding
        
    <====




    C. THE ls Command
    ====>
        Moving on now, let's explore the ls command
        A quick note, all this does is to help us list out all the files and folders we have in a folder or Present in our Desktop

        Right now, in your git bash Terminal, type in the command: "ls" and see what happens
        IF there are any files or folders in the Folder you entered your ls command into, you get a list of all files and folders present

        NOTE: Folders are the yellow stuffs and they have no exension(i.e you cannot see a folder having a.pdf at the end)... If you see that, then thats a file and not a folder
        In summary now, anything that ends with a .pdf, .txt, .zip, .mp3, .mp4, e.t.c is a file 
        AND things with no dots(. e.g .txt) at the end is a Folder


        The goal of what I did here was to clarify to you what a file is and what a folder is
        
    <====


    D. SUMMARIZING THE CLASS
    ====>
        Here we talkedabout the mkdir command, the touch command, and the ls command

        mkdir(short for make directory): It helps us create a directory which can also be called a folder
        touch: Helps us create a File(you can create a PDF file, a .docx[microsoft document file], .html file) or whatever type of file with this command
        ls(short for list): THis Command helps us list out all the files, and folders present in the directory(folder) we are in

        PRACTICE:
            Create a Folder and call it myFavouriteFood
            Create Four files inside myFavouriteFood Folder: a .mp3 file, a .mp4 file, a .txt file, a .html file, a .pdf file and a .css file in it

            Finally, in the myFavouriteFood directory, try out the ls command and list out all the files you have in it


    <====


    I HOPE YOU ENJOYED TODAY'S CLASS

    KEEP PRACTICING ALL OF THIS, KEEP CREATING DIRECTORIES WITH DIFFERENT NAMES, KEEP CREATING DIFFERENT FILES, AND HAVE FUN :)

    DON'T FORGET: GO FOR DISCIPLINE IN CODING AND NOT MOTIVATION IN CODING
