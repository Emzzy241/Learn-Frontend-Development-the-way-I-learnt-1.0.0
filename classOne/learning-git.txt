=================>  WELCOME WELCOME WELCOME  <=============

====> I am So Excited to have you here with me,My real name is Mojiboye Emmanuel Oluwole but I get called 
Dynasty, Emzzy'sDynasty, Emmanuel, MJ, MB and even the Reverend Father, you can call me any of the above names or just give me a name yourself :) <====

===> Now before I go ahead and start bugging your head on what to write in your newly bought PC, I want you to pause for a second and ask yourself why you 
WANT TO LEARN TO CODE, ASK YOURSELF: "WHY DO I WANT TO LEARN TO CODE"...... If you love writing with a pen like me, state that reason down; you can also make use of an online notepad
or whatever, just ensure you know the WHY of your CODING JOURNEY. And if you still can't pick up the Why, no Problem Just keep on Learning with me <===


====> Here's a little bit of analogy: AND THEN THERE'S YOU; You keep lookng on Twitter, Instagram and you see posts related to software development and then you go: "WHEN WOULD I LEARN TO CODE" or if you are like me that was always asking the question "GOD WHEN WOULD I BE A PROGRAMMER LIKE THEM".
